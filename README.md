# Predicting congenital syphilis cases: a performance evaluation of different machine learning models

## Abstract:

Among the sexually transmitted infections (STIs), the incidence of syphilis has increased in the last 10 years, in spite of the presence of an effective and available treatment. The epidemiological implications are especially important during pregnancy since it can lead to complications related to prematurity, stillbirth, and miscarriage, in addition to congenital syphilis, characterized by multisystem involved in the newborn. In light of this situation, this work proposes a performance evaluation of different machine learning models to classify possible outcomes of congenital syphilis, using clinical and sociodemographic data from pregnant women that were assisted by a social program in Pernambuco, Brazil, named \textit{MÃ£e Coruja Pernambucana} Program (PMCP), enabling better monitoring and care during gestation. Based on a rigorous methodology, we propose six experiments using three feature selection techniques to select the most relevant attributes, pre-process and clean the data, apply hyperparameter optimization to tune the machine learning models, and train and test models to have a fair evaluation and discussion. The AdaBoost-BODS-Expert model, an Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) model that used attributes selected by health experts, presented the best results in terms of evaluation metrics and acceptance by health experts from PMCP. This can give more confidence and allow adoption in daily usage to classify possible outcomes of congenital syphilis using clinical and sociodemographic data.
